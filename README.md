# to-do-working-schedule

## Description

This project is to create a working to-do list with functions that keep track in real-time.

- My motivation for this project was to practice the uses of third party APIs.
- I built this project to test using sources such as jQuery and moment.js.
- This problem solves utilizing extra tools to build websites and add them to my arsenal.
- I learned how to utilize third party APIs to further the complexity of a website.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
