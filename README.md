# to-do-working-schedule

## Description

This project is to create a working to-do list with functions that keep track in real-time.

- My motivation for this project was to practice the uses of third party APIs.
- I built this project to test using sources such as jQuery and moment.js.
- This problem solves utilizing extra tools to build websites and add them to my arsenal.
- I learned how to utilize third party APIs to further the complexity of a website.

## Usage

Usage is to set different plans for a schedule and save them at different dates.
